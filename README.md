# PrewittVision
PrewittVision is an efficient image processing application that leverages parallel programming techniques using CUDA to perform accelerated edge detection on .png images. By implementing the Prewitt Operator on blocks of pixels in parallel, PrewittVision delivers high-performance gradient image generation, highlighting detected edges.
